Good morrow!

I use this account for both school and personal projects. I might split my personal projects into a different account in the future, though. If you know who I am, great. If not, too bad!

I know Python very well and I am learning Java. I also know how to use JSON.

Fare thee well.

(P.S. Maybe I'll make the rest of my README Shakespearean in the future, but I can't be bothered right now.)
